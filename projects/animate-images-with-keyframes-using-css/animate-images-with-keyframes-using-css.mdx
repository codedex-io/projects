Images are quintessential to any website. It's the sparkle and it's the pizzaz! 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/AqxBcsJ.png" description="" />

You may recall using this line to add an image to your HTML file.

```html
<img src="your-path.png" alt="red chocolate chip cookie" />
```

You may also remember that we can use CSS to add styling to our image! 

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 500px; 
  height: auto;
  display: block;
  margin: 20px auto; 
}
```

Now, for something new: we can add some fun animations like _this_:

and _this_: 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/oYGbPkH.gif" description="html review" />

using CSS `@keyframes` !! (We'll explain more soon...) And the best part- we don't have to use JavaScript for it! 

## What are animations in CSS

Before we get started, it's important to note what animations are in CSS. Animations are made up of a series of frames, or in this case, HTML elements that change over time. 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/oYGbPkH.gif" description="html review" />

### keyframes

CSS animations have "steps" in them (also known as keyframes) to signify each moment of change in the animation. 

For example, 

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```
```css
@keyframes colorChange {
  0% { background-color: red; }
  50% { background-color: yellow; }
  100% { background-color: red; }
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation: colorChange 2s infinite;  
}
```

would look like 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/bBzHFra.gif" description="flashing yellow and red box" />

So at 0% of the animation, the color is red, at 50% it's yellow, and at 100% or at the end, it's red again, hence the loop! 

Let's also take a look at this line of code: 

```css
animation: colorChange 2s infinite;  
```

- `colorChange` is the name of our animation 
- `2s` is the length in seconds of how long the animation lasts
- `infinite` is indicating it will loop forever

The line of code above is attached to the `.box` class from our HTML file! Animations can only show up if they are defined in the `animation:`. 

## Easing 
Easing in CSS animations is essential to understanding the pace in which an animation progresses over time. 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/9C7DeEg.gif" description="easing demo from mdn web docs" />

Some common ones you'll see: 

- `linear`: Constant speed
- `ease`: Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down
- `ease-in`: Starts slow, then accelerates
- `ease-out`: Starts fast, then decelerates
- `ease-in-out`: Combines `ease-in` and `ease-out`

These can differ and are added right in the `animation:` of your CSS. 

```css
.tinker_bell {
  animation: bounce 1s linear infinite;
}
```

**Note:** Easing can get pretty complicated based on the type of motion you want to create! You can review the open source [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function) for more information on easing and animation examples. 


### Spin Animation

Think of the last time you saw a spinning loader: 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/lW1fWrY.gif" description="spinning loader" />

This can be recreated with a spin animation like so: 

```html
<div class="sensei">
  <img src="sensei.png" alt="club penguin gray sensei penguin" />
</div>
```

```css
/* spinning animation */
@keyframes spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.sensei {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center; 
  height: 100vh; 
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

```

Here, we're using the CSS function `rotate()` to establish which degree we want to start and end at. In this example, we're using the keywords `from` and `to` which are shortcuts for `0%` and `100%`. 

The result of the club penguin sensei looks like this 🔥🔥

## Hovering Animation 

Imagine you're playing a video game and you're choosing which character to play as, or you're in an idle mode. 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/PVfHyBD.gif" description="game mode idle hovering player" />

This is a hovering animation that we can create with keyframes! 

```html
<div class="sensei">
  <img src="sensei.png" alt="club penguin gray sensei penguin" />
</div>
```
```css
/* bouncing animation (floating)  */
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-30px);
  }
}

.sensei {
  animation: bounce 1s linear infinite;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center; 
  height: 100vh; 
}
```

Here, we're translating (aka moving) the object's Y position by 30 pixels halfway through the animation, and returning it to its original spot at the end using a `linear` ease. 

The beautiful result: 

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/69VUqyO.gif" description="club penguin sensei hovering" />


To achieve this animation speed, we set the length of time to `1s`, but you can play around with this value to get the effect you want! 


## Conclusion

Congrats! You've learned the basics of CSS image animation, and as you can tell, it's a world of opportunities to add flair to your website or project! ✨✨✨

Some other ways you can animate images include:

- bounce effect
- heartbeat pulse 
- zoom in/out
- shake or vibration
- pop on hover
- wave effect 
- + many more!
