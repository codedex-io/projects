## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how some apps and sites let you check the weather?

In this tutorial, we're going build a web app that displays the current weather, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a special ingredient... APIs!

With the power of [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) and a bit of coding magic, we can check our local weather forecast.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned to:

- Fetch asynchronous data with an API key.
- Organize content with a CSS layout model.
- Change what's on the rendered page.

The finished weather app will look and work like this:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/finished_weather_app.gif" alt="Finished Weather Application" />

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, we'll need to create the folders and files that will hold the code for our project. Let's begin by opening a terminal and creating a new folder named **weather-app** using the `mkdir` command. Then, go into this folder by using the `cd` command:

```
mkdir weather-app
cd weather-app
touch index.html styles.css script.js
```

This will create the following files in the **weather-app** folder:

- An **index.html** file to render the application.
- A **styles.css** file for customizing the appearance of our application.
- An **script.js** file where we will fetch our weather data.

We will return to these files later on. But for now, let's head over to OpenWeather!

## Step 2: Get API Key From OpenWeather

OpenWeather provides several APIs (or application programming interfaces) for fetching weather-related data. 

If you haven't already, you must create an OpenWeather account with a username, email, and password:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/new_open_weather_account_form.png" alt="Form for new account with OpenWeather" />

**Note:** You'll be sent a verification email; make sure to answer it!

Next, you'll be prompted to state what you want to do with OpenWeather's API.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/open_weather_account_prompt.png" alt="Prompt by OpenWeather (post-login)" />

I recommend choosing "Education/Science" or "Other".

You should now be ready to view your API key! After creating a new account, a new key should be generated for you. Near the top right, select your username, followed by "My API keys" in the dropdown:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/open_weather_api_key.gif" alt="Screen for generating new keys for OpenWeather API" />

After confirming you have an active API key, let's move on to the next step!

## Step 3: Write HTML

It's time to start writing some code!

Let's return to our code editor and re-open the **index.html** file.

Add the following HTML to start:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <title>Weather App</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

Aside from the necessary `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, we've included a `<link>` element in the `<head>` to connect our HTML with our **styles.css** file (which we'll work on in the next step).

Next, let's add the following HTML inside the `<body>` element:

```html
<body>
  <main>
    <section id="weather-wrapper">
      <h1>Weather App</h1>
      <div id="weather-search">
        <input id="search" type="text" placeholder="Search by city" />
        <input id="submit" type="submit" onclick="fetchWeather()" value="Search" />
      </div>
      <div id="weather-data" style="display: none;"></div>
    </section>
  </main>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

The `<main>` element holds all of our app structure, and includes a `<section>` element with the following:

- An `<h1>` heading element.
- A `<div>` element with two `<input>` elements for searching for weather by city.
- The other `<div>` is empty for now, but will be populated with the data returned by the `fetchWeather()` function we'll write later on.

We also added a `<script>` element to connect our HTML with the **script.js** file.

**Note:** The `<script>` element is written before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure all of the HTML is loaded and accessible to JavaScript.

If we save the **index.html** file and open it on the browser, it should look like this:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_html_only.png" alt="Rendered Weather App (HTML only)" />

It's looking pretty bare-bones right now. But not to worry! We'll take care of that in the next step.

## Step 4: Write CSS

Let's add a little pizazz to our weather app by styling it with CSS!

For the most of this step, we will use plain CSS. However, we'll also use a fun layout model for CSS called Flexbox to help arrange our application content.

Inside of our **styles.css** file, let's begin by adding the following:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  background-image: url(https://bit.ly/4bcK1Hc);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Here's what we did in the snippet above:

- First, we're selecting everything (i.e., `*`), defaulting the `margin` and `padding` to zero, and factoring the `padding` and `border` into element sizes with `box-sizing: border-box`.
- Then, we're making the `body` as tall as the screen on which it is rendered with `100vh`. We're also setting its `font-family` information, with a default `sans-serif` font.
- Lastly, we are setting a `background-image` by passing an image link of Brooklyn (where Cod√©dex is based) to the `url()` function. Feel free to use your own image, though!

Next, we're gonna select the `<main>` element and add the following styles:

```css
main {
  background-color: rgba(227, 193, 173, 0.85);
  position: relative;
  top: 30%;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 5px;
  min-width: 540px;
  max-width: 50%;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 2em;
}

h1 {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

We styled the `<main>` element with the following:

- We added a `background-color` with RGB values, as well as a fourth value that makes the element 85% "see-through."
- It was given a `relative` position, and placed 30% from the `top` of the screen.
- Some box layer settings were added, including `border`, `border-radius`, and `padding`.
- We gave it a `min-width` of 540px and a `max-width` of 50%.
- Since the `<main>` element is a block element, we centered it with `margin: auto`. 

Lastly, we added some space below the `h1` element with `margin-bottom`.

Let's save our **styles.css** file. At this point, our rendered weather app should look like this:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_1.png" alt="Rendered app with some CSS" />

Now, let's make the `<input>` elements appear larger to better match the `<h1>` heading above them. Select these elements with `#search` and `#submit`, and add the following:

```css
#search {
  border-radius: 5px 0 0 5px;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 70%;
  height: 42px;
}

#submit {
  border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 5em;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Both of these elements get the same styles for `padding`, and `font-size`.

The `#search` element gets a 70% `width`, as well as a `height` of `42px` and no `border`.

The `#submit` element gets a `width` of `5em`, along with a `cursor: pointer` style that makes the arrow turn into a pointing hand while hovering above this element.

Let's save **styles.css** and re-render the page:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_2.png" alt="Rendered app with more CSS added" />

Next, we're going to apply some CSS Flexbox to easily center-align the content in our weather app.

Select the `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` elements, and add the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
}
```

This turns the `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` elements into flex containers. Therefore, their child elements become flex items that we can align with certain properties.

Update these elements with the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  place-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
  width: 50%;
}
```

By default, flex items are displayed in a row. But we changed this for the `#weather-wrapper` element by setting `flex-direction` to `column`.

To center-align the items, we used the `place-items` property. We also made the `#weather-search` element half the width of its parent `#weather-wrapper` element.

If we save the **styles.css** file again, the rendered page should look like this:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_3.png" alt="Rendered app with even more CSS added" />

Excellent! Our app is coming together!

In the next step, we will code the JavaScript for our weather app. However, it will involve coming back to style our `#weather-data` element!

## Step 5: Write JavaScript

Remember the submit-type `<input id="submit" type="submit" >` element we created in the last step? It had an `onclick` attribute set to a function called `fetchWeather()`.

In this final step, we are going to write this `fetchWeather()` function! Afterwards, when we type something and use the "Search" button, this function will activate every time.

### Define Our Function

Let's open our **script.js** file and start by defining a new `fetchWeather()` function:

```js
function fetchWeather() {

}
```

This function takes no parameters. Next, let's create a few variables inside the function:

```js
function fetchWeather() {
  let searchInput = document.getElementById("search").value;
  const weatherDataSection = document.getElementById("weather-data");
  weatherDataSection.style.display = "block";
  const apiKey = "REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY"; 
}
```

In the snippet above, we did the following:

- We created a `searchInput` variable with the `#search` element's value, selected via `document.getElementById()`.
- We also selected the `#weather-data` element, where our search result will appear.
  - When we first made this element in Step 3, its `display` property was set to `none`. We changed this to `block` in the function so the fetched data can be seen.
- Lastly, we initialized an `apiKey` variable with a placeholder string. Make sure to replace this with your OpenWeather API Key (from Step 2).

**Note:** Never, ever share your API keys in public to prevent hacking and inappropriate use of API services. If you intend on pushing your tutorial code to a place like GitHub, replace the value of `apiKey` with a comment or empty string.

Since we now have a variable representing the `#weather-data` element, let's add an `if` statement that displays a custom message for empty input with the `innerHTML` property of the `weatherDataSection` variable:

```js
if (searchInput == "") {
  weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <h2>Empty Input!</h2>
    <p>Please try again with a valid <u>city name</u>.</p>
  </div>
  `;
  return;
}
```

**Note:** Make sure this is done in the `fetchWeather()` function.

Next, let's define two inner functions that will help us with getting our weather information.

```js
function fetchWeather() {
  // Previous code

  async function getLonAndLat() {

  }

  async function getWeatherData(lon, lat) {

  }
}
```

We need these functions to use two separate APIs from OpenWeather:

- One gets a location's longitude and latitude coordinates from a typed name.
- The other gets current weather data based on those coordinates.

You may have noticed that these functions have the `async` keyword in front of them. We'll be using the companion `await` keyword, along with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch" target="_blank">`fetch()`</a> function, to ensure we get valid weather information each time.

### Write getLonAndLat() Function

First, let's write the code for the `getLonAndLat()` function that will use OpenWeather's GeoCoding API to return the longitude and latitude data based on our `searchInput`.

We're only going to search by location. Therefore, the `searchInput` should be a string of a valid location or city name (e.g., "Pittsburgh" or "Brooklyn, NY").

**Note:** But feel free to add more search criteria to this code (e.g., zip code)!

Let's define two variables in `getLonAndLat()`:

```js
async function getLonAndLat() {
  const countryCode = 1;
  const geocodeURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=${searchInput.replace(" ", "%20")},${countryCode}&limit=1&appid=${apiKey}`;
}
```

We defined a `countryCode` integer that is needed for the GeoCoding API to work. Next, we made a `geocodeURL` of the API endpoint that includes the `countryCode` along with the `apiKey` we defined earlier.
 
**Note:** The `countryCode` for the U.S. is 1, but yours may be different. Try searching for yours [here](https://countrycode.org/).

To return the longitude and latitude data, we need to fetch it from the API. Let's add the following to `getLonAndLat()`:

```js
const response = await fetch(geocodeURL);
if (!response.ok) {
  console.log("Bad response! ", response.status);
  return;
}
```

This returns a response object from the API. However, because this data is coming from another computer (probably a server), it may not be returned immediately. Also, the program is allowed to run ahead, even if there is no response yet.

This is why we use `async/await`; the `await`-part prevents the associated `async` function from continuing until response data is returned from `fetch()`. We then store this in a `response` variable. If we get a bad response (i.e., `!response.ok`), then an error message is logged and nothing is returned.

Next, we want to get the actual geocode data in JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation). We can use the `response` object's `.json()` to do this! And since the data is coming from the response, it is asynchronous and we must use the `await` keyword:

```js
const data = await response.json();
```

Then, let's add the following `if`/`else` statement below where we defined `data`:

```js
if (data.length == 0) {
  console.log("Something went wrong here.");
  weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <h2>Invalid Input: "${searchInput}"</h2>
    <p>Please try again with a valid <u>city name</u>.</p>
  </div>
  `;
  return;
} else {
  return data[0];
}
```

If our API call wasn't successful, our `data` array will be empty and an error message will be rendered. Otherwise, there should be a JSON object stored as the first element and we'll return that in the `else` clause.

Now it's time to work on the next inner function!

### Write getWeatherData() Function

The `getWeatherData()` function accepts a `lon` and `lat` parameter that will be used in the API call for the current weather data. This information comes from the `getLonAndLat()` function we defined earlier.

Because this function will also works with fetched response data, it also gets the `async` keyword.

First, we'll define a `weatherURL` variable and assign the other OpenWeather API endpoint string to it:

```js
const weatherURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${apiKey}`;
```

Next, we'll define a `response` variable and assign to it the object returned by the `fetch()` function with the `weatherURL` passed in.

**Note:** Don't forget the `await` keyword for the `response` and `data` variables!

```js
const response = await fetch(weatherURL);
if (!response.ok) {
  console.log("Bad response! ", response.status);
  return;
}

const data = await response.json();
```

Like before, we'll print an error message and return nothing if there's a problem. Otherwise, we'll press on and make another `data` object with the JSON object for the current weather data.

### Display Weather Data

For this next part, we'll finish work inside of the `getWeatherData()` function, as well as in the outer `fetchWeather()` function. We'll be displaying the `data` information we just got to our HTML file. Then, we'll get to actually see the requested API data displayed on the browser!

Using the weather information from the `data` variable, let's do the following with the `weatherDataSection`:

```js
weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
<img src="https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${data.weather[0].icon}.png" alt="${data.weather[0].description}" width="100" />
<div>
  <h2>${data.name}</h2>
  <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> ${Math.round(data.main.temp - 273.15)}¬∞C</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ${data.weather[0].description}</p>
</div>
`
```

We used the `.innerHTML` property to assign some new HTML to the selected `#weather-data` element, such as:

- `data.weather[0].icon` for an image representation of the current weather.
- `data.name` for the location/city.
- `data.main.temp` for the temperature (measured in [Kelvins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) by default, hence the rounding).
- `data.weather[0].description` for a brief description of the current weather.

We are now finished with writing the `getWeatherData()` function! But now, we need to actually use the functions we just defined to finish writing the outer `fetchWeather()` function.

Near the closing curly brace `}` of the outer `fetchWeather()` function, add the following:

```js
document.getElementById("search").value = "";
const geocodeData = await getLonAndLat();
getWeatherData(geocodeData.lon, geocodeData.lat);
```

- First, we reset the value of the `searchInput` to an empty string so that the text input is cleared on the app after searching.
- Next, we defined a `geocodeData` variable with the longitude and latitude data returned by the `getLonAndLat()` function.
- Lastly, we simply invoked the `getWeatherData()` function and passed in the `.lon` and `.lat` properties of the `geocodeData` variable.

Since the data returned by `getLonAndLat()` is asynchronous response data, we placed an `await` keyword before it. Therefore, we need to add the `async` keyword to our outer `fetchWeather()` function:

```js
async function fetchWeather() {
  // Rest of code below
}
```

Let's save **script.js** and test if our app now displays weather data when we search by location.

### Style Weather Data

We're almost finished!

There are just a few last things to do for both the CSS and JavaScript files. Our `#weather-data` element is behaving as expected, but now let's style it a bit more!

In the `getWeatherData()` function, let's place the weather information beside the icon by changing the `display` property of the `weatherDataSection` variable from `"block"` to `"flex"`:

```js
weatherDataSection.style.display = "flex";
weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
<img src="https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${data.weather[0].icon}.png" alt="${data.weather[0].description}" width="100" />
<div>
  <h2>${data.name}</h2>
  <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> ${Math.round(data.main.temp - 273.15)}¬∞C</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ${data.weather[0].description}</p>
</div>
`
```

We made the `#weather-data` element a flex container with JavaScript code... wow! Go ahead and save **script.js**.

Now, re-open the **styles.css** file and add the following to the bottom:

```css
#weather-data {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 1.5em;
  margin-top: 20px;

  text-align: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 12px;
}

#weather-data > img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: lightskyblue;
}
```

In the snippet above, we added some more styles to the `#weather-data` element, including:

- A `background-color` that is semi-transparent (`rgba()`).
- Some box layer settings for `border-radius`, `padding`, and `margin-top`.
- Center-aligned text.
- A few Flexbox-centric properties that align the icon and weather info towards the center and puts a little gap between them.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! We finished building our weather application!

Let's go ahead and save our **styles.css** file one last time! Refresh the rendered page and try typing in your favorite city:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/finished_weather_app.gif" alt="Finished Weather Application" />

Using the three building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we were able to build a functional application that uses some deep frontend and backend elements such as:

- Asynchronous programming with API data and web-based functions like `fetch()`.
- Arranging content via CSS Flexbox.
- Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) with `document.getElementById()`.

How would you build upon this application? Some ideas could be adding more data like humidity and wind/gust speed, or including a 5- or 10-day forecast.
