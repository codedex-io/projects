## Introduction

[Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) was one of the first games that made me curious about how software actually works. I grew up playing it as a sandbox where creativity and logic overlapped. 🧱

This project tutorial comes from that curiosity. Instead of just playing Minecraft, we are going to extend it by writing our own Java code and create a working Minecraft mod. If you have ever wanted to understand how mods work under the hood or take the first step into game modding, this is the place to start.

**Mods** (short for modifications) are a way of writing code to alter graphics or gameplay of a game.

There are 200k+ Minecraft mods on mod hosting sites. It's the most modded game of all-time by downloads.

We are going to build a mod that creates a **custom item** in Minecraft:

### But first... What is Forge MDK?

This project tutorial requires a setup of the Forge MDK’s project structure and parchment. 

The **Forge MDK** is the official starter kit you use when you want to build a Minecraft mod using the Forge mod loader. Think of the it as a pre-configured project template for modding Minecraft. 🛠️

The name MDK, which stands for Mod Development Kit, came from the SDK, which stands for Software Developer Kit (i.e. Android SDK, iOS SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Windows SDK, PlayStation SDK).

Minecraft was not built to be changed easily. The Forge MDK is like a translator that lets our code talk to Minecraft safely. Without Forge, Minecraft wouldn't know:

- What your mod is.
- When to load it.
- How to show your item in the game.

The Forge MDK provides:

- Folders that tell you where to put your code and images.
- Tools that run Minecraft with your mod installed.
- Readable names for Minecraft code so it is easier to understand.
- Rules so your mod does not break the game or other mods.

This can be very tedious to follow, so I have included a Forge MDK folder with the setup done.

## Downloading IntelliJ & Java

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) is an IDE by JetBrains that helps us write, organize, and run Java code more easily by giving us tools like syntax highlighting, error checking, and one-click project running. It is widely considered to be the best Java IDE for professional use. I am using this for Java, but you can also use Eclipse and VS Code.

**Download here:** https://jetbrains.com/idea/download (scroll down to Community version so it's free)

Also, make sure you have the Java JDK Version 21 installed for your operating system (Linux/macOS/Windows).

**Download here:** https://oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html 

Let's get started.

## Setting Up

The first thing we will do in this tutorial is make sure the folders are able to be accessed easily. 

This can be done through clicking the three dots "⋮" on the project, like this:

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/xAsFBf5.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

And in "Appearance", ensure “Flatten Modules”, “Flatten Packages”, and “Compact Middle Packages” are all turned off (unchecked). If they were on, it would make adding directories and files to existing ones harder.

Right-click the **itemmod** folder under the **codedex** folder (can be accessed through **src** -> **main** -> **java** -> **com** -> **codedex**) and press new. We will be creating a new Package. You should see a popup, just add “item” to the end of the line, like so:

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4r25NPl.png)

When the package is created, right click the item package, press new, and create a new class. We will name this “ModItems”. At this point, there should only be one file within the item package. 

Your **itemmod** folder should look like the following:

![screenshot2](https://i.imgur.com/DDzpUXJ.png)

Open **ModItems**, we will begin to write some code in here:

![screenshot3](https://i.imgur.com/5x38mEM.png)

In IntelliJ IDEA, you can use autocomplete to automatically add `import` statements. While this is convenient and prevents typos, let's list all imports explicitly at the top of the file to maintain consistency.

Below the first line, add the following `import` statements:

```java
package com.codedex.itemmod.item;
import com.codedex.itemmod.ItemMod;
import net.minecraft.world.item.Item;
import net.minecraftforge.eventbus.api.IEventBus;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.DeferredRegister;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.ForgeRegistries;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.RegistryObject;
```

Our first line of code will tell Minecraft that we are attempting to register a new item. This should be inside the ModItems class with correct indentation.

```java
Public static final DeferredRegister<Item> ITEMS = 
  DeferredRegister.create(ForgeRegistries.ITEMS, ItemMod.MOD_ID);
```

`DeferredRegister<Item>` is a Forge helper class that allows you to register game objects (like items) in a safe way. The `<Item>` tells Forge that we are specifically registering an item, as opposed to other things like monsters. `ItemMod.MOD_ID` tells Forge which mod namespace the item belongs to (prevents conflicts with other mods).

Next, we need to define the item’s identity in the game and ensure it is safely registered at the correct point in the mod loading process.

```java
public static final RegistryObject<Item> Codedex = ITEMS.register(name."codedex", () -> new Item(new Item.Properties()));
```

`RegistryObject<Item>` is a special container that holds a reference to the item once it is registered, acting like a “promise” that the item will exist after the registration process completes. 

The `.register()` method adds the item name `"codedex"`, which **must be all lowercase to comply with Minecraft’s naming rules**. The second argument is a lambda expression, `() -> new Item(new Item.Properties())`, which tells Forge how to construct the item when it is time to register it, with `Item.Properties()` allowing you to define its characteristics, such as stack size or creative tab placement. 

For our last code within this file, we need to link our item definition to Forge’s event system, so that they appear at the correct time during Minecraft’s initialization. 

```java
public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) 
  ITEMS.register(eventBus);
}
```

The `.register()` method takes an IEventBus as a parameter, which is a pipeline that handles mod-related events. Inside the method, `ITEMS.register(eventBus)` tells Forge, “When it’s time to register items, run the registration code for everything in this DeferredRegister.”

Congrats! The first file is done. Your `ModItems` class should now look similar to this:

```java
package com.codedex.itemmod.item;
import com.codedex.itemmod.ItemMod;
import net.minecraft.world.item.Item;
import net.minecraftforge.eventbus.api.IEventBus;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.DeferredRegister;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.ForgetRegistries;
import net.minecraftforge.registries.RegistryObject;

public class ModItem {
  public static final DefferedRigester<item> ITEMS = 
    DefferedRegister.create(ForegeRegistres.ITEMS, ItemMod.MOD_ID);

  public static final RegistryObject<Item> Codedex = ITEMS.register(name: "codedex", () -> new Item(new Item.Properties()));

  public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
    ITEMS.register(eventBus);
  }
}
```

Since we are adding an item into the game, we need to make sure it’s accessible in creative. Go to the **itemmod** class within the **item** folder, and find the `.addCreative()` method. It should be empty and look like this.

```java
// Add the example block item to the building blocks tab
private void addCreative(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event)
{

}
```

Within the method, we need to ensure that when Minecraft is loading up and processing the Creative Mode code, it adds the Codedex item we had registered before. This will allow it to be accessible within the Creative Menu. Basically, we are saying “put Codedex into the COMBAT tab.” You can also change where the item will appear, such as changing COMBAT into INGREDIENTS. 

```java
private void addCreative(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event)
{
  if (event.getTabKey() == CreativeModeTabs.COMBAT) {
    event.accept(ModItems.Codedex);
  }
}
```

This code checks if Minecraft is currently building the Ingredients creative tab, and if so, it adds your registered item (Codedex) to that tab so it appears in the creative inventory. In short: “If Minecraft is currently building the combat creative tab, put Codedex into the Ingredients tab.” 

We will also need a line in the ItemMod class:

```java
ModItems.register(modEventBus);
```

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/i8aaon3.png)

We are almost done! This next section covers how we set up the item’s assets (such as how it appears in-game), make sure you follow closely. 

Within the **resources** folder, we will create a folder called **assets**. 

Within **assets**, we need to create the folder **itemmod**. 

Finally, within **itemmod**, we need to create three folders: 

- **lang** which holds language files that define the names and text shown in Minecraft.
- **models** which defines the 3D models or item/block shapes for your mod.
- **Textures** which contains image files used for your items and blocks.

At the end, the file structure within resources should look like this:

```
resources
  |__ assets
       |___ itemmod
              |__ lang
              |__ models
              |__ textures
```

In the **lang** folder, we will create a new file, called **en_us.json**. 

Inside it we will write:

```json
{
 "item.itemmod.codedex": "Codedex"
}
```


In the **models** folder, we will create another folder called **item**, and inside it, we create a file called **codedex.json**. 

Inside of that, we write:

```json
{
 "parent": "minecraft:item/generated",
 "textures": {
   "layer0": "tutorialmod:item/codedex"
 }
}
```

Lastly, in **textures**, we create a folder called **item**, and inside it, we add a file called **codedex.png**. 

You can add a photo yourself of whatever you want this item to look like, but here's a photo of Codedex Bot logo:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yA845P4.png" alt="closing ceremony image" width="30%"/>

We are finished! Click “run” at the top of the IDE, and Minecraft should load within a few minutes. 

Create a new single-player world in creative, and search up "Codedex". 🔎

## Congrats!

Bruh, we just built your first Minecraft mod using Java. Not too bad, right?

### Common Mistakes to Watch Out For

When modding with Forge, beginners often run into issues like:

- Item names using uppercase letters (Minecraft requires lowercase IDs)
- Folder names not matching the mod ID exactly
- Missing registration calls in the main mod class
- Textures not appearing because of incorrect file paths

### How to Debug Your Mod

If your mod does not load or your item does not appear:
- Check the console log for red error messages
- Make sure Minecraft reaches the “Done” stage during loading
- Verify that your texture file name matches the JSON model exactly
- Confirm your mod ID is consistent across code and resources

### Going Further with Forge

Once you are comfortable with items, you can explore:
- Adding custom blocks
- Creating entities or mobs
- Using Forge events to react to things happening in the world
- Saving data with capabilities
- Making your mod configurable with config files
