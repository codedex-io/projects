**Versions:** HTML5, VS Code 1.85.1

## Introduction

HTML ultimately rests underneath the websites we use. But how can we test or preview the websites we build with HTML on our local computer?

This tutorial shows a few ways to do just that!

**Note:** Make sure to create a new **index.html** file somewhere on your computer. Then place anything in the `<body>` element so we can render it later.

## Option A: Double-Click the File

The first option involves using our computer's file manager ("Finder" for Mac; "File Explorer" for Windows).

This is how to access a web page in Mac:

If you double-click the **index.html** file, it should open on your default browser window. Boom, you just opened a web page!

**Note:** This page is not on the internet; you can tell by looking at the file path in the browser. It exists locally on your computer.

Every time you make a change to your **index.html** file, just save the file and then refresh the browser window to render the updated page.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this:

- Saving on VS Code: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
- Refreshing a web page: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>

To open a page in Windows:

Like with the Mac Finder, double-click the **index.html** file and a browser window should open the page.

## Option B: Live Server (VS Code Extension)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor for building websites. It uses extensions for added functionality, including running HTML locally!

### VS Code Overview

If you're not familiar with VS Code, or you don't have it installed, you can follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/set-up-your-local-environment-in-python#setting-up) to do so.

After installing, launch VS Code by double-clicking the icon. When the window opens, there is a group of icons located on the left-side (highlighted below):

This is known as the "Activity Bar." The topmost icon is the "Explorer", where you can create files and folders for your projects! Let's select this icon and then create a new **index.html** file (if needed).

Extensions give us special abilities such as code highlighting and formatting. Thousands of extensions are available for install via the "Extensions" icon in the Activity Bar:

Alternatively, we can access with "View" > "Extensions" or keyboard shortcuts:

- Windows: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>
- Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>

Let's now explore one that supports HTML!

### Live Server

A popular extension for running local HTML is the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

When installed, it can start a new `localhost` server for an **.html** file via a "Go Live" button near the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/run-a-website-locally-with-html/live-server-button.png" alt="VS Code Live Server button on bottom-right of window" />

This button appears while viewing an **.html** file on VS Code. When clicked, a new `localhost` server is started and can be accessed at an address such as `127.0.0.01.5501/filename.html`.

If you edit and save the file while the server is still running, the browser automatically refreshes the page:

## Conclusion

Congrats! You learned two ways to run and preview local HTML. Whether you're using your file manager or a VS code extension, you have options for your next project!
