## Introduction

Have you ever used the randomize button in a video game's character creator? (…how many hours of Baldur's Gate 3 do you think we've played? ⚔️)
<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/jkgf7of.gif" description="" />

Or, remember Cher's closet from [Clueless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clueless), which helped her plan outfits by swiping through a catalogue of her entire wardrobe?
<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/TYmiJnX.gif" description="" />

These are both examples of randomizer generators!

There are other types of cool generators out there in games, movies, and TV shows. We can use the same logic to design monsters or even avatars.

Today, we'll be learning how to use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS to build our own Randomizer Generator.

## Getting Started

Create a new HTML/CSS/JS project in [Codédex Builds](https://www.codedex.io/builds) or your code editor of choice!

## Code Structure

If you've taken the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses, our web stack for this project will look familiar. We have an HTML file that links to an external CSS stylesheet and an external JavaScript file, all contained within the same folder.

```
CluelessGenerator/
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  └── script.js
```

## HTML

HTML buttons allow users to interact with the outfit generator. These buttons control the behavior of the app, such as randomizing outfits and cycling through different images of accessories, tops, and bottoms. 

Here’s what each part does:

### Main Container

Below the header, add a `<div>` that wraps everything:

```html
<div class="main-container">
  
</div>
```
Everything else will go inside this container.

### Randomize Button

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/PL9cXAX.gif" description="" />

This button, labeled "randomize!", triggers the randomization of outfit pieces when clicked. It's located at the top and has the `id="random-btn"`.

 ```html
<button class="random-button" id="random-btn">randomize!</button>
```

### Outfit sections

Next, add three sections (Add Ons, Tops, and Bottoms), each with an image, and two arrow buttons below them (previous and next).

First, create the container section for Add Ons (hats and glasses):
```html
<div class="addons-container">
  <img id="addOns" class="addons-image" src="" alt="accessories" />
  <div class="carousel-buttons">
    <button id="0prevBtn">←</button>
    <button id="0nextBtn">→</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

Then, follow the same format to create the Tops section and the Bottoms section. Make sure to change the `img id`, `class`, and `alt` descriptions, as well as the values of `button id`.

Each section has an empty image to be filled by JavaScript, uses unique IDs to match with your script later, and contains two buttons for cycling through images of the outfit pieces within each category.

## CSS Styling

### General Layout and Centering

The HTML and body elements use flexbox to center the content both horizontally and vertically. This ensures that all elements appear in the center of the screen, no matter the screen size.
```css
html {
  background-color: #ff5f1f;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; 
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden; 
}
```

### Main Container

The `.main-container` holds all of the sections (like the images and buttons). The flexbox layout inside the container ensures that the sections are stacked vertically with a small gap between them.

```css
.main-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; 
  align-items: center; 
  gap: 15px; 
  padding: 10px;
}
```

### Image Styling

The images in the outfit categories (add-ons, tops, bottoms) are set to take up 90% of the available width, with a maximum width of 250px. The aspect ratio ensures they keep their proportions. This makes sure the images look good on all screen sizes.

```css
.addons-image,
.tops-image,
.bottoms-image {
  width: 90%; 
  max-width: 250px; 
  aspect-ratio: 3 / 4; 
  object-fit: contain; 
}
```

### Buttons Styling

The buttons are styled with a bright pink background and white text. A hover effect is added, so when you move the cursor over the button, the background turns darker. The "randomize" button is styled with a green background to make it stand out.

```css
button {
  font-size: 1rem;
  color: white;
  background-color: #ff69b4; 
  padding: 8px 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #d90166; 
}

.random-button {
  background-color: green; 
}
```

Here's what out generator will look like at this point:

## JavaScript

### Randomizer Logic
In the starter code, the random button has a placeholder function:

 ```js
document.getElementById("random-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Randomize button clicked!");
});
```
This means the button works, but it doesn't do anything useful yet. It just logs a message to the console.

We'll replace the placeholder with a function that actually changes each outfit piece randomly. First, we loop through each category:

```js
for (const cat in categories) {
  const category = categories[cat];
```
 
This lets us access the `addOns`, tops, and bottoms categories one by one.

 Inside the loop, we'll generate a random number that matches an image index:

``` js
category.index = Math.floor(Math.random() * category.images.length);
 ```
This gives us a random index between 0 and the number of images - 1.

 After picking the new index, we'll call:

 ```js
updateImage(cat);
```
This shows the new image on screen using the category’s updated index.

Finally, we'll connect the real `randomize()` function to the button:

 ```js
document.getElementById("random-btn").addEventListener("click", randomize);
```

### Arrow Buttons Logic

The arrow buttons (`prevBtn` and `nextBtn`) allow the user to navigate through the images of each category (`add-ons`, `tops`, `bottoms`). These buttons let you go forward and backward through the images in a loop:

When the Next button is clicked, the index for the category increases by 1, and the `updateImage()` function is called to update the displayed image.

```
document.getElementById(category.nextBtn).addEventListener("click", () => {
  category.index = (category.index + 1) % category.images.length;  // Loop back to the first image
  updateImage(cat);
});
```

When the Prev button is clicked, the index decreases by 1, and again, the `updateImage()` function is called. It loops back to the last image if you go backward from the first one.

```
document.getElementById(category.prevBtn).addEventListener("click", () => {
  category.index = (category.index - 1 + category.images.length) % category.images.length;  // Loop to last image
  updateImage(cat);
});
```

The `%` modulo operator is used here to make the images cycle in a continuous loop.

Voila! Here's our final result for the outfit generator.

And here's our [final code](https://www.codedex.io/@Julien/build/randomizer-generator-final-code).

## Bonus Challenges

### Avatar Creator

You can use the same logic above to create a monster or an avatar. Here's a fun example, using the heads, torsos, and legs of monsters from Monster's Inc, Inside Out, Minions.

<RoundedImage link="https://i.imgur.com/HHmRCzg.png" description="" />

This example also shows an alternate way of designing the arrows so the three characters swap heads, torsos, and legs at the same time. 

### Adding more categories

So – what if we have our avatar and want to add another category, like shoes? Here's how we'd do that:

In the HTML, you'll need to add a new section for shoes. This will look similar to how the other sections are structured. You would add the following HTML code:

```html
<div class="shoes-container">
  <img id="shoes" class="shoes-image" src="" alt="shoes" />
  <div class="carousel-buttons">
    <button id="3prevBtn">←</button>
    <button id="3nextBtn">→</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

This creates a new section with an image for shoes and navigation buttons (previous and next). You can place this code in the `<div class="main-container">` along with the other categories.

To add CSS styling for the shoes category, follow the same pattern as for other categories! Anywhere that you currently have
```css
.addons-image,
.tops-image,
.bottoms-image 
```
You'll also add `.shoes-image`.

In JavaScript, you'll need to add a new category to the categories object. Each category includes an array of images, an index to track the current image, references to the HTML elements, and button IDs for navigation. Here's how you'll add the shoes category:
```
const categories = {
 ...
  shoes: {  
    images: [
      // Your shoe images go here
    ],
    index: 0,
    element: document.getElementById("shoes"),
    nextBtn: "3nextBtn",
    prevBtn: "3prevBtn",
  },
};
```
You'll add a `shoes` key with an array of image URLs, an index to track the current image, an element to target the HTML image element, and button IDs for the next and previous buttons.

### Mismatch

If you've already added a fourth section, try making a feature that toggles a pop-up that says "mismatch!" when the outfit doesn't match. Or, if you're creating a monster, the feature could say the sound the monster would make, depending on the combinations.
