## Introduction: Companion Creatures

[Baldur’s Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3) (BG3) is a 2023 RPG by Larian Studios, adapted from Dungeons & Dragons. It's earned over 10 million players due to its expansive worldbuilding, fleshed out characters, and stunning visuals. 

Anyone who's played knows it features some truly epic battles, with animal allies who fight alongside you, like our best boy, Scratch.

The game is incredibly well designed, but have you ever wanted to make Baldur’s Gate 3 *a little sillier*? 

Well, remember the Addled Frog you met in Auntie Ethel’s swamp? It’s normally not a recruitable companion, but what if you could summon it to help you win your battles? 🐸 

We're going to do just that by making our own mod! 

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/8NiJnGA.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="Baldur's Gate 3 frog"/>

**Mods** (short for modifications) are a way of writing code to alter features, graphics, or gameplay of an existing game, even for huge titles like Baldur's Gate 3.

We’ll create a mod that lets your character cast a spell to spawn their frog friend anywhere. That frog friend is a playable character who can help out during battles! 

Since BG3 Lua modding is only supported on Windows, this tutorial is aimed at Windows users. If you're a Mac user, scroll down to our Resources section for some links!

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to:

- Write a BG3 mod that lets you summon a custom companion with Lua 
- Customize the companion’s stats
- Test your mod in-game

**Note:** Special thanks to [Jon Hinkerton](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5366) for creating the original mod that inspired this tutorial.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Baldur's Gate 3 installed on your machine! If not, start [installing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3) it in the background while you create your mod.

If you don't already have a code editor installed, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Otherwise, you can use another code editor of choice.

### BG3 Script Extender

**BG3 Script Extender (BG3SE)** is a program created by a developer named @Norbyte that adds Lua scripting and console support to Baldur's Gate 3. Download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se). 

Right click on the downloaded **.zip** file, select [Extract All], and extract the files to a new folder in your **Documents** directory, and name it something like **ModdingTools**. 

Next to your **ModdingTools** folder, create a new folder called **Mods**. 

We'll be keeping:

- Our modding apps in the **ModdingTools** folder.
- Our working files in the **Mods** folder.

Here's the structure you'll be working with inside the **Mods** folder (you'll learn how to create the **meta.lsx** files and both **.lua** files in a bit!)

### Starter files

[Here’s a zip folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JOE5uq8Ky6MKy3agzan6Zqdr7Z2HAYtJ?usp=sharing) containing the starter files for this project! It contains the basic file structure you’ll be working with. 
```

                    ├── Object.txt
                    ├── Spell_Target.txt
```

## Set up the .lsx file 

An **.lsx** (XML) file tells Baldur’s Gate 3 about your mod, including its name, author, folder location, version, and unique ID, so the game can recognize and load it correctly. 

The **meta.lsx** file tells the game info about your mod, including what the mod is called, who made it, where its files live, and how to tell it apart from other mods. We’ve provided you with a boilerplate **meta.lsx file** inside the project folder. 

It contains the following components:

- `UUID`: A unique ID number for your mod.
- `Folder`: The name of the folder that holds your mod’s files (inside the **Mods/** directory).
- `Name`: The display name of the mod. This is what shows up in BG3’s Mod Manager or in-game.
- `Author`: The creator’s name (you!).
- `Description`: A short blurb about what your mod does.
- `Version`: A number you can bump up when you release updates so the game (and users) know it’s a new version.

Without this file, the game doesn’t know your mod exists.

A **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)** is a 128-bit value used to uniquely identify information across systems or databases without significant risk of duplication. 

It looks something like: `30b78323-c06f-4a66-9767-6241f5ee4656`.

It'll make sure your mod is unique and doesn't interfere with another mod installed on the same system. We’ve left it blank, so generate your own by using this [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4), and paste it in here:

```xml
<attribute id="UUID" type="FixedString" value="your UUID goes here" />
```

## Setting up .txt files

In Baldur’s Gate 3, most of the game’s data, like characters, spells, and items, is stored inside **.pak** files. These are packed files that the game reads directly, so you can’t edit them in a normal text editor.

To make modding easier, the BG3 modding community uses tools to export, convert, and edit these files in a readable **.txt** format before putting them back into the game.

Inside the **Data** folder, you should see three text files:

- **Character.txt** is empty right now but it will define the stats for your frog, including Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and other abilities. It will also include special boosts, resistances, and spells that the frog can use.
- **Object.txt** contains information about the object that interacts with the frog, like a teapot or magical item that summons it. This includes the item’s name, rarity, and any effects it grants (for example, unlocking the summon spell when equipped or used).
- **Spell_Target.txt** defines the spells themselves. It includes the summon spell you can cast to bring the frog into the game, as well as the frog’s own spells or attacks it can use in battle to help you out!

We’ve pre-populated **Object.txt** and **Spell_Target.txt** with example entries so you can see how the structure works (and because it’s a ton of metadata to sort through!) 

We left **Character.txt** blank, so open it up, and let’s fill it out together!

We’ll write the header first.

```
new entry "Frog_Summon"
type "Character"
using "_Critter"
```

- `new entry` is the internal name of your creature.
- `type "Character"` is always "Character" for creatures, NPCs, or summons.
- `using "_Critter"` pulls in the default critter template so you don’t have to define every single property from scratch.

Next let’s set up our frog’s stats!

```
data "Strength" "2"
data "Dexterity" "15"
data "Constitution" "8"
data "Intelligence" "2"
data "Wisdom" "8"
data "Charisma" "4"
```

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/5kqogmE.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="image of frog's stats"/>

These are all standard DnD stats. Feel free to change these numbers around!

```
data "Vitality" "2"
data "Weight" "1"
data "StepsType" "Clawed"
```
- `Vitality` is the base number of hit points (hp).
- `Weight` affects physics and interactions.
- `StepsType` determines footstep sound/animation (Clawed, Hoofed, etc.).

Next, let’s set up how the frog acts in combat and what abilities it has

```
data "SpellCastingAbility" "Dexterity"
data "ActionResources" "ActionPoint:1;BonusActionPoint:1;Movement:9;ReactionActionPoint:1"
data "Passives" "AttackOfOpportunity;ShortResting"
data "DefaultBoosts" "Skill(Stealth,6);IncreaseMaxHP(Owner.Level*2);UnlockSpell(Target_Claws_Bufo);ProficiencyBonus(SavingThrow,Dexterity);ProficiencyBonusOverride(Owner.LevelMapValue(StandardProficiencyBonusScale));RollBonus(Attack,max(Owner.DexterityModifier,Owner.SpellCastingAbilityModifier));IF(ConditionResult(GetSummoner(context.Source).Intelligence > 17) or ConditionResult(GetSummoner(context.Source).Wisdom > 17) or ConditionResult(GetSummoner(context.Source).Charisma > 17)):SpellSaveDC(2);UnlockSpell(Target_HypnoticPattern_Bufo);ScaleMultiplier(2);WeightCategory(+4);ObjectSize(+4);Ability(Strength,+8);Ability(Constitution,+8);Ability(Dexterity,-8);AC(-4)"
data "AcidResistance" "Resistant"
data "DifficultyStatuses" "STATUS_EASY:PLAYER_BONUSES_EASYMODE"
data "UnarmedRangedAttackAbility" "Dexterity"
```
- `data "SpellCastingAbility"` determines which stat the creature uses for spell attacks and spell save DCs. In this example, the frog’s spells are powered by Dexterity, so attack rolls and DCs use the Dexterity modifier.
- `data "ActionResources"` defines what the creature can do on its turn.
- `data "Passives"` lists abilities that are always active.
- `data "DefaultBoosts"` are automatic bonuses or effects applied to the creature. 
- `data "AcidResistance"` sets resistances. Options include None, Resistant, or Immune. In this case, the frog resists acid damage, since it can make acid attacks.
- `data "DifficultyStatuses"` adjusts stats or abilities based on game difficulty.
- `data "UnarmedRangedAttackAbility"` determines which stat the creature uses for unarmed ranged attacks, in this case it’ll use Dexterity.

Phew, our frog friend sure is powerful!

## Write your Lua Script

The core logic: Summon our Frog friend when you cast the spell, and make sure only one Frog can be spawned at a time.

As you saw in your file folder structure, you'll create two Lua scripts:

###  BootstrapServer.lua

The first script is **BootstrapServer.lua**. Write the following code inside:

```lua
Ext.Require("Server/Frog.lua")

print("BootstrapServer.lua loaded")
```

Here, we are telling Script Extender to load our **frog.lua** file which contains the game logic, and once it's finished loading, we tell the game to run the code inside (in this case, a print message that says the mod has loaded!).

###  Frog.lua

The second script is **Frog.lua**.

By default, the `Target_Summon_Frog` spell just spawns a new frog every time it’s cast. If you cast it twice, you’d have two frogs. If you cast it ten times, you’d have a swarm of frogs!

This script fixes that by ensuring that any existing frog is removed before a new one is created. That way, you’ll always have exactly one frog active.

Write the following code:

```lua
local function KillFrog()
    local summons = Osi.DB_PlayerSummons:Get(nil)
    for _, summon in pairs(summons) do
        if string.match(summon[1], "Frog") ~= nil then
            Die(summon[1])
        end
    end
end
```

`Osi.DB_PlayerSummons:Get(nil)` queries the game for all currently active summons belonging to the player. The script checks them one by one.

`string.match(summon[1], "Frog")` says that if the summon’s identifier (its internal name) contains "Frog", we’ve found a frog.

`Die(summon[1])` kills that frog immediately. Don’t fret though! We aren’t literally killing the frog, we’re just making sure we don’t spawn a million frogs and accidentally crash the game.

Below that, write:

```lua
Ext.Osiris.RegisterListener("UsingSpell", 5, "before", function(caster, spell, targettingType, school, StoryActionID)
    if spell == "Target_Summon_Frog" then
        KillFrog()
    end
end)
```

`Ext.Osiris.RegisterListener("UsingSpell", 5, "before", ...)` registers a listener for the `UsingSpell` event in the game’s scripting system.

`UsingSpell` fires whenever someone casts a spell, and it contains `5` parameters. `before` means the function runs before the spell’s normal effects are applied.

Inside the callback function, we check if the spell being cast is `Target_Summon_Frog`. If yes, the program runs `KillFrog()` to clean up any old frogs.

## Export your Mod to a .pak

Before your mod shows up in Baldur’s Gate 3, you’ll usually need to package it into a **.pak** file. This isn’t done in BG3 itself, you’ll use external tools made by the modding community.

A **.pak** file is a type of “package” file, primarily used in video games, that bundles multiple game data files like graphics, textures, sounds, and other assets into a single file for easier management and distribution.

### BG3 Modders Multitool

Download [BG3 Modder’s Multitool](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool), which is a beginner-friendly open source tool that lets you unpack BG3’s files, browse models, and export your own mod into **.pak** format. 

Extract the contents of the .zip folder into the **ModdingTools** folder so you can run the tool separately from your mod files.

- Open BG3 Modder’s Multitool (installed outside the game).
- Select your project folder (**Mods**).
- Click Build Mod, which generates a **.pak** file.

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/wjDsrkV.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="screenshot of multitool"/>

The **.pak** should be saved here:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods\
```

## Load and Test Your Mod

Open BG3 Mod Manager, and drag your **.pak** mod from Inactive Mods → Active Mods.

Click [Save Load Order] and [Export].

Now you can go right into launching Baldur's Gate 3! Start a new game. 

The Script Extender console should load automatically, but if you don’t see it, make sure you’re running your game in Windowed mode, and press <kbd>~</kbd> key to check for errors.

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/ApKaBqS.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="BG3SE Console"/>

You’ll be able to find the teapot containing the frog in the Tutorial Chest at the very beginning of the game, on the Tutorial Level (the Nautiloid ship). Walk past Shadowheart and open the chest in the next room.

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/iO4Zxr3.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="Discovering the teapot containing Frog"/>

## Bonus Challenges

Try changing the frog’s stats! For example, you can scale the frog into a GIANT frog by altering the number inside `ScaleMultiplier()` in the **Character.txt** file.

<ImageZoom src="https://i.imgur.com/yYwLo1m.png" style={{ width: "80%", height: "auto" }} alt="BIG FROG"/>Fun fact: that's Jackie’s BG3 character on the right

You can also try summoning other creatures! The best way to understand Mod files is to download existing ones and play around. 

Download one of these mods that use similar logic and let you summon a [Ghost Cat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5720), a [Tressym](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5742), or even a [Pet Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7217).

## Conclusion

Congrats! You just made your first Baldur’s Gate 3 mod! 🎉
