## [#](#-introduction) Introduction

With more than 55 million units sold, [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is a one of the world’s most popular strategy games ever. The idea behind it is to guess an unknown sequence of coloured pegs in the fewest number of attempts possible. Despite having simple rules the game is still very difficult and entertaining.

Because representing colors in a terminal is not an easy task, we are going to create a more *modern* version of the Mastermind game. In 1977 Invicta released an electronic version of the game where the colored pegs were replaced by an array of up to five digits. In this tutorial we are going to recreate it in Python.

## [#](#-rules) Rules

The rules are really simple:
- A random 4 digit secret code is generated
- The player will input a 4 digit number trying to guess the secret code
- The number of digits that are correct and in the right position is returned
- The number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position is returned

## [#](#-generate-a-random-number) Step 1. Generate a random number

In order to generate a random number we need to use the `random` module. More specifically we are going to use `randrange` method.

```python
from random import randrange
```

The `randrange` method returns a random number within the specified range. To generate a 4 digit number we need our range to be between 0 and 10000 (the largest number generated would be 9999)

```python
number = randrange(10000)
```

There is only a small problem. If the generated number is smaller than 1000 we will end up with a secret code that has less than 4 digits.

To fix that we need to add zeroes at the beginning of the number until it reaches 4 digits.

The easiest way to do it is converting the number to a string and justify it to the right with `rjust` by adding `0` until it has `4` digits.

``` python
number = str(number).rjust(4, '0')
```

We now have our random secret code.

## [#](#-read-users-guess) Step 2. Read user's guess

The next step is getting user's guess. To do that we will use the `input` function. 

We use `isnumeric` to check that all the characters taken as input are numeric and `len(guess)` to make sure that the guess has 4 digits.

If any of those conditions are not met, we will ask again the user for a guess.

We set `guess = 0` to execute the instructions inside the while the first time.


```python
guess = 0
while (guess.isnumeric() == False or len(guess) != 4):
  guess = input('Guess the four digit number: ')
```
The `guess` read with `input` is treated as a string, same as the secret code `number`.

## [#](#-additional-variables) Step 3. Additional variables

We need a variable to count the correct digits in the right position

```python
correct_position = 0
```

and one to count the correct digits in the wrong position

```python
correct_digit = 0
```
We will also use a copy of `number` in order to keep track of the digits that have already been matched and the ones that are left unmatched

```python
unmatched = number
```

## [#](#-count-guessed-digits-in-the-right-position) Step 4. Count guessed digits in the right position

To count how many digits of the `guess` match the ones in `number` we need to check all of them in pairs.
Because there are 4 digits we need to iterate the check 4 times so we use `range(4)`.

If both `guess` and `number` have the same digits in the same positions, we increment the `correct_position` counter.

To keep track of the matched digits and exclude them later whene we count the right digits in the wrong positions, we conventionally set `unmatched` to `f` at the position of the matched digit. This way `f` will never match with any digit from 0 to 9

```python
for i in range(4):
  if (guess[i] == number[i]):
    unmatched = unmatched.replace(guess[i], 'f', 1)
    correct_position += 1
```

## [#](#-count-guessed-digits-in-the-wrong-position) Step 5. Count guessed digits in the wrong position

There is no need to count the right digits in the wrong position if we already matched all 4.

```python
if (correct_position < 4):
```

We will only execute the next instructions if the condition above is true.

Once again we use `range(4)` to iterate over all 4 digits.
This time the digits are compared between `guess` and `unmatched`.
We check if `guess[i] in unmatched` and if that's true we increment the `correct_digit` counter.

The `guess` variable has not been change at all but we **must not** check the digits that have already been matched in the right position.
That is done by also checking if `guess[i] != number[i]` (or if `unmathced[i] != 'f'`).

```python
if (guess[i] in unmatched and guess[i] != number[i]):
  unmatched = unmatched.replace(guess[i], 'f', 1)
  correct_digit += 1
```
Like the last time, the matched digits in `unmatched` are set to `f` so they will be excluded in the next iteration.

## [#](#-printing-guessed-digits-and-winning) Step 6. Printing guessed digits

At this point both `correct_position` and `correct_digit` counters should have the right values. We just need to print them.

```python
print('Digits in right position: ' + str(correct_position))
print('Digits in wrong position: ' + str(correct_digit))
```

## [#](#-counting-the-number-of-guesses-and-winning) Step 7. Counting the number of guesses and winning

The whole code after the `number` generation needs to be inside a

```python
while (guess != number):
```

Each time the code is executed we need to increment the `tries` variable

```python
tries += 1
```

If the `while` condition is not satisfied that means `guess == number` so the secret number has been guessed.

We tell the user that he won and we also tell him how many attempts it took

```python
print('You are a mastermind! You guessed the number in ' + str(tries) + ' tries')
```

## [#](#-code) Code

The whole code should look like this:

```python
from random import randrange
# Generate a random number from 0 to 10000
number = randrange(10000)
# Add padding to the number if it doesn't have four digits
number = str(number).rjust(4, '0')
tries = 0
guess = 0

while (guess != number):
  tries += 1
  guess = ''
  # unmatched will keep track of the digits that have not been guessed
  unmatched = number
  correct_digit = 0
  correct_position = 0
  # Read a four digit number
  while (guess.isnumeric() == False or len(guess) != 4):
    guess = input('Guess the four digit number: ')
  # Count the guessed digits in the right postion
  for i in range(4):
    if (guess[i] == number[i]):
      # Set the guessed digit to 'f' in unmatched
      unmatched = unmatched.replace(guess[i], 'f', 1)
      correct_position += 1
  # Count the guessed digits in the wrong position
  if (correct_position < 4):
    for i in range(4):
      if (guess[i] in unmatched and guess[i] != number[i]):
        # Set the guessed digit to 'f' in unmatched
        unmatched = unmatched.replace(guess[i], 'f', 1)
        correct_digit += 1
    print('Digits in right position: ' + str(correct_position))
    print('Digits in wrong position: ' + str(correct_digit))
print('You are a mastermind! You guessed the number in ' + str(tries) + ' tries')
```

## [#](#-improvements) improvements

To improve this project you could try to:

- Increase the number of digits the user has to guess. With 4 digits the possible permutations are 10000.
- Allow the user to use a [custom seed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed) for the secret number. This could allow multple users to compete against each other and try and guess the same number.
- Try to code your own solver by implementing [Knuth's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Worst_case:_Five-guess_algorithm).
