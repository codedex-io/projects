## Introduction

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) is a live streaming platform where millions of people come together every day to watch, chat, and create content in real time. Launched in 2011 as a site focused on video game streaming, Twitch has since expanded to include music, art, sports, and “just chatting” streams. 👾

For history buffs and the OGs, Twitch originated as **Justin.tv**, a website launched in 2007 by Justin Kan, Emmett Shear, Michael Seibel, and Kyle Vogt (now household names in San Francisco).

Very quickly, Twitch became an underground sensation. During college, my roommates and I spent countless hours watching streamers play our favorite game, Dota 2, while eating and hanging out. It was a centerpiece of our “sadboy” days and a platform that meant so much to us.

We even streamed! Here’s me streaming a Dota 2 match in 2014 to 13 viewers. 😅

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/sdllIwn.gif)

Now in 2026, streamers like Kai, Speed, and Ludwig are taking it to new heights and breaking records.

In this project tutorial, we will explore a dataset about top Twitch streamers and uncover fun insights using SQLite. These are _real_ data from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), a website with 500,000+ public datasets.

The two CSV files / choices we have for you are:

- [Top 1000 Twitch Streamers (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hibrahimag1/top-1000-twitch-streamers-data-may-2024) featuring names like [KaiCenat](https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat), [Jynxzi](https://www.twitch.tv/jynxzi), [shroud](https://www.twitch.tv/shroud).
- [Top 1000 Twitch Streamers (2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata) featuring names like [xQc](https://www.twitch.tv/xqc), [summit1g](https://www.twitch.tv/summit1g), [TimTheTatman](https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman), [pokimane](https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane).

Do you recognize any of these names? Pick your poison (dataset) and let’s dive in!

GLHF. 🤘

### Setting Up

First, install SQLite if you don't have it. Check out our [Setting Up SQLite Locally](https://www.codedex.io/sql/bonus/sqlite) bonus article for help.

And then open your terminal and test it with: 

```terminal
sqlite3
```

You should see a prompt that says `sqlite>`. 

![sqlite3 GIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/refs/heads/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/sqlite3.gif)

Download _one_ of the CSV files and open it up to make sure the CSV file is working:

- **[streamers2024.csv](https://github.com/codedex-io/projects/blob/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/streamers2024.csv)**
- **[streamers2021.csv](https://github.com/codedex-io/projects/blob/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/streamers2021.csv)**

No need to download both! It's always a good idea to focus on one dataset at a time.

You can download by clicking on the "..." button > "Download".

![Download GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/refs/heads/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/github-download.png)

A **CSV** file stands for **C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alues file. It’s a simple way to store spreadsheet data in a plain text format. Each line in the file represents a row, and the columns in that row are separated by commas. 

So the **streamers2021.csv** data looks like this on GitHub:

![streamers2021 screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/refs/heads/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/streamers2021.png)

But behind the scenes, the plain text is just:

```output
channel, watch_time, stream_time, peak_viewers, average_viewers, followers, followers_gained, views_gained, partnered, mature, language
xQcOW, 6196161750, 215250, 222720, 27716, 3246298, 1734810, 93036735, True, False, English
summit1g, 6091677300, 211845, 310998, 25610, 5310163, 1370184, 89705964, True, False, English
Gaules, 5644590915, 515280, 387315, 109761767635, 1023779102611607, True
ESL_CSGO, 3970318140, 517740, 300575, 7714,3944850, 703986106546942, False
Tfue, 3671000070, 123660, 285644, 29602, 8938903, 206842478998587, False
... and so on
```

In a CSV file, the first row is typically the "header row", which contains the column names.

The column names are:

- `channel`
- `watch_time`
- `stream_time`
- `peak_viewers`
- `average_viewers`
- `followers`
- `followers_gained`
- `views_gained`
- `partnered`
- `mature`
- `language`

And the **streamers2024.csv** data looks like:

```plaintext
rank, name, language, type, most_streamed_game, 2nd_most_streamed_game, average_stream_duration, followers_gained_per_stream, avg_viewers_per_stream, avg_games_per_stream, total_time_streamed, total_followers, total_views, TOTAL_GAMES_STREAMED, ACTIVE_DAYS_PER_WEEK, MOST_ACTIVE_DAY, DAY_WITH_MOST_FOLLOWERS_GAINED
1, kaicenat, English, personality, Just Chatting, I'm Only Sleeping, 7.6, 18405, 15852, 2.3, 4698, 10600000, 9150000, 194, 3.6, Friday, Saturday
2, jynxzi, English, personality, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, NBA 2K20, 5.4, 3386, 1145, 1.2, 8407, 5760000, 1950000, 54, 5.6, Tuesday, Sunday
3, caedrel, English, personality, League of Legends, I'm Only Sleeping, 6.3, 689, 12331, 1.3, 6728, 797000, 14200000, 111, 2.8, Thursday, Sunday
4, caseoh_, English, personality, NBA 2K23, Just Chatting, 4.6, 7185, 0, 3.6, 2554, 4220000, 53,385, 6.2, Friday, Monday
5, ibai, Spanish, personality, Just Chatting, League of Legends, 4.1, 8289, 190714, 1.5, 6865, 15600000, 359000000, 149, 4.3, Wednesday, Saturday
... and so on
```

The column names are:

- `rank`
- `name`
- `language`
- `type`
- `most_streamed_game`
- `2nd_most_streamed_game`
- `average_stream_duration` (minutes)
- `followers_gained_per_stream`
- `avg_viewers_per_stream`
- `avg_games_per_stream`
- `total_time_streamed`
- `total_followers`
- `total_views`
- `total_games_streamed`
- `active_days_per_week`
- `most_active_day`
- `day_with_most_followers_gained`

Both datasets have 1,001 rows: 1,000 streamers plus one header row.

Let’s move back into our terminal and start the database.

### Create SQLite Database

In the terminal, type:

```terminal
sqlite3 twitch.db
```

If you want to keep everything in the same folder (say you created a **twitch-project** folder on your desktop), you will have to `cd` (change directory) into the folder you want before the `sqlite twitch.db`:

```terminal
cd Desktop
cd twitch-project
sqlite3 twitch.db
```

If you don't know how the terminal works, definitely check out the [Command Line](https://www.codedex.io/command-line) course.

Inside the SQLite prompt, create a table called `streamers2021`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE streamers2021 ( 
  channel TEXT PRIMARY KEY, 
  watch_time INTEGER,
  stream_time INTEGER,
  peak_viewers INTEGER,
  average_viewers INTEGER,
  followers INTEGER,
  followers_gained INTEGER,
  views_gained INTEGER,
  partnered TEXT,
  mature TEXT,
  language TEXT
);
```

These names (and the data types) have to match the CSV columns, or else there will be an error later.

If you choose the other dataset, create a table called `streamers2024`: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE streamers2024 ( 
  rank INTEGER  PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  language TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  most_streamed_game TEXT,
  second_most_streamed_game TEXT,
  average_stream_duration REAL,
  followers_gained_per_stream INTEGER,
  avg_viewers_per_stream INTEGER,
  avg_games_per_stream REAL,
  total_time_streamed INTEGER,
  total_followers INTEGER,
  total_views INTEGER,
  total_games_streamed INTEGER,
  active_days_per_week REAL,
  most_active_day TEXT,
  day_with_most_followers_gained TEXT
);
```

I made sure it's not `2nd_most_streamd_game`, but instead `second_most_streamed_game` because column names cannot start with a number.

### Import CSV into SQLite

It’s time to move our data from the CSV file into a SQL table.

Suppose we are working on the 2021 dataset, make sure the CSV file is in the same computer folder.

Then in the SQLite prompt:

```terminal
.mode csv
.import streamers2021.csv streamers2021
```

And of course if you are using the 2024 dataset, it's `.import streamers2024.csv streamers2024`.

To make sure it’s working:

```
SELECT *
FROM streamers2021
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see something like:

```plaintext
xQcOW,6196161750,215250,222720,27716,3246298,1734810,93036735,True,False,English
summit1g,6091677300,211845,310998,25610,5310163,1370184,89705964,True,False,English
Gaules,5644590915,515280,387315,10976,1767635,1023779,102611607,True,True,Portuguese
ESL_CSGO,3970318140,517740,300575,7714,3944850,703986,106546942,True,False,English
Tfue,3671000070,123660,285644,29602,8938903,2068424,78998587,True,False,English

sqlite>
```

The data is now in a table, and we are ready to analyze it. ✅

**Note:** If you ever want to start over with a new table, you can delete a table with `DROP TABLE streamers;`

### Getting a Feel for the Dataset

So usually, I like to start by selecting the first 10-20 rows from the table to see the column names:

```
SELECT *
FROM streamers2021
LIMIT 20;
```

Which we've already done. This also let's use get a feel for the data.

To list out the column names again:

- `channel`
- `watch_time`
- `stream_time`
- `peak_viewers`
- `average_viewers`
- `followers`
- `followers_gained`
- `views_gained`
- `partnered`
- `mature`
- `language`

This is kinda hard to understand since there are so many columns, so I would do:

```sql
SELECT channel, followers
FROM streamers2021
LIMIT 25
```

To get the top 25 streamers in 2021.

### Spoken Languages

Let’s find all the unique languages in this dataset using the `DISTINCT` keyword:

```
SELECT DISTINCT language
FROM streamers2021;
```

The results should look like: 

- English
- Portuguese
- Spanish
- German
- Korean
- French
- Russian
- Japanese
- Chinese
- Czech
- Turkish
- Italian
- Polish
- Thai
- Arabic
- Slovak
- Other
- Hungarian
- Greek
- Finnish
- Swedish

For `streamers2024` table, you can do distinct games:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT most_streamed_game
FROM streamers2024;
```

- Just Chatting
- Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
- League of Legends
- NBA 2K23
- Minecraft
- World of Warcraft
- VALORANT
- Dota 2
- Grand Theft Auto V
- Apex Legends
- PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS
- Overwatch
- Counter-Strike
- Street Fighter 6
- Sports
- Brawl Stars
- Trackmania
- Warframe
- Rocket League
- Teamfight Tactics
- Software and Game Development 😮
- Valorant
- Escape from Tarkov
- FIFA 21
- Hearthstone
- etc.

Notice how some of the games like Valorant appear twice as `VALORANT` and `Valorant`. This means that the data could be cleaned better. We'll come back to this in a bit.

## Using Aggregate Functions

Now it’s a good time to write down the questions that we have. 

Here are some of mine:

- _How many people on average watched these streamers in 2021?_
- _Who were the hottest rising streamers in 2021?_
- _What are the most popular games in 2024?_
- _These are some big numbers from the game League of Legends (also known as LoL). Where are these LoL stream viewers located in 2024?_
- _What is the best day to stream in 2024?_

Let’s go through each of these one by one.

### How many people on average watched these streamers in 2021?

In 2021, Twitch had about 8.46 million unique streamers active each month. That means, to be in the top 1,000 dataset, you are literally in the 0.01% of the all streamers in the world. So how many people actually watches these people each time?

For this, we can use the `AVG()` aggregate function:

```sql
SELECT AVG(average_viewers)
FROM streamers2021;
```

The average would be:

```plaintext
4776.26373626374
```

4,776 people tune in on average to these streamers! Dang, that's not as high as I thought. Now I don't feel as bad when we stream to < 100 people on [Codédex's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codedex_io).

### The Hottest Rising Streamers in 2021

Aka who gained the most followers?

For this, we can use the `MAX()` function with the `GROUP BY` & `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT channel, MAX(followers_gained)
FROM streamers2021
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY MAX(followers_gained) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

The results are:

```plaintext
auronplay|3966525
Rubius|3820532
TheGrefg|3593081
Bugha|2220765
pokimane|2085831
```

These streamers all gained 2-3 million followers each in 2021. Wow. And I just looked them up... they are all still streaming in 2026! Going strong.

### Top 10 Most Popular Games in 2024

To find out this one, we need to use `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT most_streamed_game, COUNT(*) 
FROM streamers2024 
GROUP BY most_streamed_game
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC; 
```

We can rewrite this using column reference numbers instead of column names: 

```sql
SELECT most_streamed_game, COUNT(*) 
FROM streamers2024
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The top games are: 

```plaintext
Just Chatting|257
League of Legends|84
Grand Theft Auto V|74
VALORANT|60
Casino|36
Fortnite|35
Dota 2|35
Counter-Strike|31
Minecraft|24
Virtual Casino|23
```

Woah! "Just Chatting" is the most popular game by far and it's not even a game. Also surprised to see "Casino" and "Virtual Casino" appearing in the top 10, I think Twitch had a gambling problem in 2024. 😂

![top 10 games](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/refs/heads/main/projects/analyze-twitch-data-with-sqlite/top-10-games.png)

Since Valorant appeared as both "VALORANT" and "Valorant", let's just make sure it's not wayyy higher:

```sql
SELECT most_streamed_game, COUNT(*)
FROM streamers2024
WHERE most_streamed_game = 'VALORANT' 
  OR most_streamed_game = 'Valorant';
```

Okay, it's 63 instead of 60, so still fourth place. Good to double check just in case!

### League of Legends Viewers: Demographic

Another question I have is around League’s international demographic. 🌎

Let’s pick a popular game like League of Legends and see what the top streamers are speaking in.

We can create a list of languages and their number of top streamers using `WHERE` and `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT language, COUNT(*) 
FROM streamers2024
WHERE most_streamed_game = 'League of Legends' 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The results should look something like:

```plaintext
English,28
Portuguese,12
French,12
Spanish,9
Japanese,7
Chinese,7
Polish,4
German,2
Turkish,1
Czech,1
Cantonese,1
```

Very international! If you want to grab just the top 5, we can add a `LIMIT 5` to cap the results:

- English 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦
- Portugese 🇵🇹🇧🇷
- French 🇫🇷
- Spanish 🇪🇸🇲🇽🇦🇷🇨🇴
- Japanese 🇯🇵

You can do this with any other game.

### Best Day to Stream in 2024

So in the `streamers2024` table, there's a `day_with_most_followers_gained` which is super interesting. My guess is that people tune in more on the weekend but let's see:

```sql
SELECT day_with_most_followers_gained, COUNT(*) 
FROM streamers2024
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

We have a winner!

```plaintext
Sunday,358
Saturday,159
Monday,138
Tuesday,127
Friday,78
Wednesday,74
Thursday,65
```

Sunday is BY FAR the best day to stream and gain followers! Noted. 🤔📝

## Grouping Top Games Into Genres in 2024

So earlier, we found the most popular games in 2024. Let's do it with a `LIMIT 25` this time:

```sql
SELECT most_streamed_game, COUNT(*)
FROM streamers2024
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

With "Just Chatting" ended up so high up, I wonder if we group some of the top games, that it would come close.

Let's try to figure out the different genres of games, and each of its viewer counts.

Group the games into their genres: 

- [IRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)
- [MOBA: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)
- [FPS: First-Person Shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter)
- [Battle Royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game)
- MMO: [Massively Multiplayer Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game)
- Simulation
- Action
- Gambling

This can be done using a `CASE` statement, which is similar to an `if`/`else if`/`else` or `switch` statement in Python, C++, or Java.

Using `CASE`, your logic should be: 

  - If League of Legends or Dota 2 → MOBA 
  - If Valorant or Counter-Strike or Overwatch or Escape from Tarkov → FPS 
  - If Minecraft → Simulation
  - etc. etc.
  - Else → Other 

Use `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to showcase only the unique game titles.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Just Chatting'
      THEN 'IRL'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'League of Legends' OR most_streamed_game = 'Dota 2'
      THEN 'MOBA'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'VALORANT' OR most_streamed_game = 'Valorant' OR most_streamed_game = 'Counter-Strike' OR most_streamed_game = 'Overwatch' OR most_streamed_game = 'Escape from Tarkov'
      THEN 'FPS'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Minecraft' or most_streamed_game = 'Dead by Daylight'
      THEN 'Simulation'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Fortnite' OR most_streamed_game = 'Apex Legends' OR most_streamed_game = 'Call of Duty: Warzone' OR most_streamed_game = 'PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS'
      THEN 'Battle Royale'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'World of Warcraft'
      THEN 'MMO'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Casino' OR most_streamed_game = 'Virtual Casino' OR most_streamed_game = 'Slots'
      THEN 'Gambling'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Sports' OR most_streamed_game = 'FIFA 23' OR most_streamed_game = 'Rocket League'
      THEN 'Sports'
    WHEN most_streamed_game = 'Hearthstone' OR most_streamed_game = 'Teamfight Tactics' or most_streamed_game = 'Chess'
      THEN 'Strategy'
  ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'genre',
  COUNT(*)
FROM streamers2024
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The result should look something like:

```plaintext
IRL|257
Other|234
FPS|123
MOBA|119
Battle Royale|88
Gambling|68
Simulation|33
Sports|30
Strategy|29
MMO|18
```

Wild to see "Just Chatting" still so ahead!

# Quit SQLite

To exit SQLite anytime, we can do either:

- Run `.quit` and hit <kbd>enter</kbkd>
- Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>

## The Results

So now that we have done, let’s write down everything that we found thus far:

- The average viewers per stream for the top 1,000 streamers in 2021 is 4,776 viewers.
- The hottest rising stars in 2021 are [auronplay](https://www.twitch.tv/auronplay), [Rubius](https://www.twitch.tv/rubius), [TheGrefg](https://www.twitch.tv/thegrefg), [Bugha](https://www.twitch.tv/bugha), and [pokimane](https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane).
- The most popular games are Just Chatting, League of Legends, GTA V, VALORANT, and Casino.
- The top languages for LoL streamers are English, Portugese, French, Spanish, and Japanese.
- The best day of the week to stream is Sunday!

This is a solid report. If you want to visualize it, you can use [Python](https://codedex.io/python), [NumPy](https://www.codedex.io/numpy), [Pandas](https://www.codedex.io/pandas), Matplotlib or Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel to create line graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, etc.

## Conclusion
 
You’ve reached the end of the project tutorial! GGWP. 🔥

We’ve taken a real-world Twitch dataset from Kaggle and imported it into SQLite, and used queries and aggregate functions to analyze the data.

Feel free to keep going and try to come up with more questions. Some other ideas:

- What are your favorite games? Can you find some interesting insights about them?
- Can you _connect_ the two datasets? How are streamers in 2024 different from 2021 ones? How many top streamers in 2021 are still in the top in 2024? Hint: Use a `JOIN` or a `UNION`.
- Any other questions that you might have?

Share your projects on GitHub or a video format in [Project Showcase](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase) if you find out something even more interesting! Let me know in the comments. ✨
