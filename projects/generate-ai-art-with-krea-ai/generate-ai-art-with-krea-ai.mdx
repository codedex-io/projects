## Introduction

Ever wondered how AI can transform your ideas into stunning visuals?

Similar to how we learned to pick up on context clues in conversations or text, AI image models reference their knowledge base to output images based on prompts. [Krea](https://www.krea.ai/home) is an AI image model that can help you visualize your text. 

In this tutorial, we will be creating a wallpaper using Krea‚Äôs pattern tool.

## How Krea Works

AI image models like Krea work based on anticipation. The image generators are trained using Language Learning Models (LLM).

Predicting images is very similar to predicting words. Let‚Äôs think of fill-in-the-blanks statements. When you are given a sentence such as:

```
Dear (name), You are (adverb) invited!
```

You can easily interpret this as an invitation and fill in the blanks. You can anticipate an invitation and fill this in accordingly.

```
Dear Ellie, You are enthusiastically invited!
```

Now, let‚Äôs make it a little harder:

```
This summer we will take a vacation in (adjective). Please respond with a (verb) to confirm your attendance.
```

This fill-in-the-blank statement is a little harder to complete without any context. This can easily be an invitation to anywhere in the world and there are so many ways to confirm attendance. So what exactly do fill-in-the-blank statements have to do with generative image models?

We can identify context clues to successfully fill in the blanks regardless of the amount of text you are presented with. Let‚Äôs think of context as noise. **Noise** in generative modeling is not sound, it is random variation in an image.

Image models are trained to reduce the noise, engineers do this by taking real images and adding a little noise to them. The models are then asked to look through the noise and correctly return a cohesive image. Like an Olympic athlete, models go through extensive training to look through the noise. Standout models such as [DALL-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) can find images in extreme noise. Much like our fill-in-the-blank sentences, these image generators try different variations to return a cohesive image.

## Vector Space

For the image-generating model to return exactly what we picture in our mind through the noise, we need to define our prompts. Let‚Äôs go back to our fill-in-the-blank statements.

```
This summer we will take a vacation in (adjective). Please respond with a (verb) to confirm your attendance.
```

This is a lot easier to fill in if I share that this invitation is for a ‚Äúvoice-message-loving family who loves the Mediterranean‚Äù. This narrows down our choices for adjectives and we can safely assume the verb in question is a ‚Äúvoice message‚Äù.

LLMs are trained to cluster concepts on a vector space. An LLM will find the next word in a sentence by looking for it in a vector space. An LLM will predict our adjective based on the context in our fill-in-the-blank example. Since the Mediterranean is mentioned in the context, it will look for a word in that vector space. In this case, an LLM will fill in the ‚Äúadjective‚Äù blank with countries or popular family-friendly destinations in the Mediterranean.

/>

Just like an LLM can correctly fill in the blank with context, we can ask our generative image models to focus on a particular region of vector space through prompting. Similar to context, the more specific the prompt the better. The more specific a prompt, the smaller the target in the vector becomes and the better the results.

## Getting Started with Krea

Now that we know a little more about what goes on behind image-generating models, it‚Äôs time to get started with Krea. 

After you sign up for a free account, head for the ‚ÄúPattern Tool‚Äù on the home page.

## Create a Pattern

Time to build! 
When you use the ‚ÄúPattern Tool‚Äù, you will be asked for two different inputs.

### Prompt

- Just like prompting ChatGPT, remember to be as descriptive as possible. In the prompt box, you will need to specify what you wish for your pattern to visually look like.

### Pattern

- A pattern is the shape that Krea will generate images around. Krea provides a few select patterns that are readily available for your use and even allows you to upload your own.

After you select a pattern and fill in the prompt, hit generate. Wall paper generated! üéâ

## Have Fun

Remember that Krea is generating images based on your prompt and selected pattern and may require a few iterations to generate a cohesive image. Krea makes generative image processing fun to work with. If you want to take it to the next level, Krea also offers [AI Video generation](https://www.krea.ai/apps/video/v1).

If you want some inspiration, look at the examples of patterns and prompts below and try to guess the album covers that inspired the prompts. üîç
